I'm developing a midi tokenization scheme. Can you generate a track using this scheme?

#basic song
```{{tokenSchema}}```

This is just a very basic example. Generate something unique. The chord progression, rhythms, drum patterns, and melodies you generate should fit the style of music requested.
The melody needs to be rhythmically interesting with notes of different lengths(short and long) as well as rests.

The drums available are:
	KD=kick
	SD=snare
	HH=hiHat
	RD=ride
	CY=cymbal
	LT=lowTom
	HT=highTom
	TP=timpani

Send the raw notation with nothing else

Using the schema, generate something to fit what follows:
